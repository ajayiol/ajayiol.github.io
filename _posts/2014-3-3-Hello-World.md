My name is Oluwadamilola Ajayi and I am a programmer. I can create and design mobile and web applications, I am fluent in many programming
languages and eager to learn new languages and improve my skills.


"Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program."- Linus Torvalds
